# BEBXSHOP Online-store with Full Frontend and Node.js.
My first Full Stack project, focused on Frontend. Backend takes small part of the whole website, using only one POST request to send information about customer to database and create payment session via Stripe payment system.

## Used languages and modules
### Languages
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Node.js

### Node.js modules
* Express.js
* Stripe
* Mongoose
* Dotenv

## Features
* Browse merchandise: users can browse through bebxshop's merchandise and view information about each product, including a description, price, and image.
* Add products to cart: users can add products to their cart and view a summary of their order.
* Checkout: users can enter their delivery and payment information and complete their purchase.
* Session data: users cart data is saved on "localstorage", so after refreshing/returning to website cart is not empty.

## Future updates
In the future, I plan to add couple of updates to bebxshop:
* Account system: logged-in users will be able to check their purchase history, receive discounts, and get emails with information about new sales on the website.
* Mailer: after the payment process, a mailer will send a letter with informantion about purchase to the user's email.
* Dynamic website: replace static HTML pages with "ejs" pages.
### Bugs to fix
* CSS: on some devices website displays incorrectly.
* JS: on some devices cart features doesn't work.
